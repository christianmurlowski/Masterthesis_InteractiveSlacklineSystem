\chapter{Questionnaires of the User Study}
This chapter presents the questionnaires provided for each participant in the study.
Not all questions were shown for the human trainer group in \textit{Demographic Data} and \textit{Guided Interview} because these were specifically related to the interactive system group.
Each questionnaire is accommodated in separate sections.
Participants fulfilled the questionnaires as structured in the following order.
