\section*{Abstract}
% The abstract should state
% (1) the principal objectives and scope of the investigation,
% (2) describe the methods employed,
% (3) summarize the results, and
% (4) state the principal conclusions.

The aim of this thesis project is to design and evaluate an interactive slackline learning training system. To evaluate the efficiency of the system the learning progress is measured while training beginners on a slackline.

In the study all participants have to execute predefined exercises that are divided into four training levels. Each exercise attempt, the time, and their confidence will be measured. Exercises will be executed without as well as with the slackline. For safety reasons gymnastic pads are placed beneath and to each side of the slackline.

During the actual exercise study, the participant will be recorded via audio and video. This will only be used for this study to evaluate and validate performance parameters and detect failures of the system. The participant will be interviewed about her experience after the training. During the interview the participant will be recorded via audio for later analyses.

\begin{itemize}
\item Kinect v2
\item Slackline
\item No interactive system
\item Just learning by doing
\item No real-time feedback to clarify if something is wrong
\item System gives this feedback
\item Measure learn progress
\item In here user will be guided through exercises
\item If such an interactive system can be used to learn user to go on a slackline
\item If such a system is at least comparable with a human trainer (maybe also video training) or even better
\item Feasibility study with experts
\item User study with beginners in 2-3 groups and 2 sessions
\item In 2. session all will train with the system
\item -
\item Problem
\item Current approaches to solve the problem
\item Problems with solutions, what would be better, what can't you do with these
\item Solution approach of thesis to make everything better, What will be better
\item Developed prototype, Used techniques, prototype design to motivate user
\item Pre-study / Feasibility study --> Why doing this? What evaluate?
\item Solve occurring problems, which exercises can be implemented + good trackable
\item Main study --> what will be tested?, number of exercises and tiers/stages and exercise levels 
\item Final results, What was good, What was bad, Usability of system
\item Assumed hypothesis true or false
