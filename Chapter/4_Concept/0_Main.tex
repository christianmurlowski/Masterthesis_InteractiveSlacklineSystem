\chapter{Concept}\label{4_concept}
This chapter describes the conceptual analysis of an interactive slackline learning system (SLS) with real-time feedback. The idea of the SLS is to provide helpful information, structured exercises, and appropriate feedback to the user for learning slacklining with the given application. 
%One main feature is the autonomous interaction with the system. 
The user should be able to interact independently of any controlling device or external support like human help. Therefore, the SLS can only be controlled by the currently interacting user. Further, it responds appropriately to the actions of the user and provides several real-time feedback indicators to support her during the exercise execution. 

In the following conceptual analysis will be elaborated. Section \textit{\nameref{4_1_general}} describes basic design principles and system related requirements. This is followed by the more specific sections \textit{\nameref{4_2_interaction}}, \textit{\nameref{4_3_stages}}, and \textit{\nameref{4_4_exercises}} that describe how to interact with the system and how exercises are structured. Another main component is to provide adequate feedback to the user, which is part of section \textit{\nameref{4_5_feedbackSystem}}. Lastly section \textit{\nameref{4_6_scenario}} gives a good overview about the workflow of the specific components.
