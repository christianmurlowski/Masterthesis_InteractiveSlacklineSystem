\chapter{Concept}

With the help of the previous \textbf{\nameref{2_relatedWork}} chapter, and the \textbf{\nameref{3_slacklining}} chapter, a concept can be built for the interactive system. Therefore this chapter elaborates a conceptual analysis. It involves \textbf{\nameref{4_1_requirements}} where general specifications of the system will be discussed as well as the target group and a scenario will be given. Section \textbf{\nameref{4_2_feedbackSystem}} describes how feedback is properly given to the user. This is then followed by the \textbf{\nameref{4_3_designInteraction}}. At last the exercises that will be implemented in the system and used for the training are described in section \textbf{\nameref{4_4_exercises}}.
