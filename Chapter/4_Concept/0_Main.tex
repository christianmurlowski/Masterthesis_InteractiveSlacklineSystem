\chapter{Concept}

With the help of the previous \textbf{\nameref{2_relatedWork}} chapter, and the \textbf{\nameref{3_slacklining}} chapter, a concept can be built for the interactive system. Therefore this chapter elaborates a conceptual analysis. It involves \textbf{\nameref{4_1_requirements}} where general features of a Kinect application will be discussed regarding the Kinect Human-Interface-Guidelines. Section \textbf{\nameref{4_2_general}} describes basic requirements of the entire system. This is followed by the more specific sections \textbf{\nameref{4_3_interaction}}, \textbf{\nameref{4_4_stages}} and \textbf{\nameref{4_5_exercises}} as well as \textbf{\nameref{4_6_feedbackSystem}}, which describes how feedback is properly given to the user. Lastly the section \textbf{\nameref{4_7_requirements_scenario}} gives a better overview about the worflow of the particular components.
