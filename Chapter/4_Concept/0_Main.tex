\chapter{Concept}
This chapter describes with the help of chapter \textit{\nameref{2_relatedWork}} and \textit{\nameref{3_slacklining}} the conceptual analysis of an interactive slackline learning system with real-time feedback. The idea of this system is to provide helpful information, appropriate exercises, and feedback techniques to the user for learning slacklining with the given application. One main feature is the autonomous interaction with the system. This gives the opportunity to be independent of other human help and therefore it can only be controlled by the user that is currently interacting with the system. It responds to the actions of the user and provides several feedback indicators for the current exercise execution to help her with exercise execution. Therefore in the following a conceptual analysis will elaborate the requirements of the system. Section \textit{\nameref{4_1_general}} describes basic requirements of the entire system. This is followed by the more specific sections \textit{\nameref{4_2_interaction}}, \textit{\nameref{4_3_stages}}, \textit{\nameref{4_4_exercises}} that describe how to interact with the system and how exercises are properly structured. Another main component is how to provide properly feedback to the user, which is part of section \textit{\nameref{4_5_feedbackSystem}}. Lastly section \textit{\nameref{4_6_scenario}} gives a good overview about the workflow of the particular components.
