\chapter{Concept}\label{4_concept}
This chapter describes with the help of chapters \textit{\nameref{2_relatedWork}} and \textit{\nameref{3_slacklining}} the conceptual analysis of an interactive slackline learning system with real-time feedback. The idea of this system is to provide helpful information, structured exercises, and appropriate feedback techniques to the user for learning slacklining with the given application. One main feature is the autonomous interaction with the system. This gives the opportunity to be independent of other human help and therefore the system can only be controlled by the user that is currently interacting with the system. It responds to the actions of the user and provides several feedback indicators to help her with the exercise execution. 

Therefore in the following a conceptual analysis of the system will be elaborated. Section \textit{\nameref{4_1_general}} describes basic design principles and system related requirements. This is followed by the more specific sections \textit{\nameref{4_2_interaction}}, \textit{\nameref{4_3_stages}}, \textit{\nameref{4_4_exercises}} that describe how to interact with the system and how exercises are properly structured. Another main component is to provide properly feedback to the user, which is part of section \textit{\nameref{4_5_feedbackSystem}}. Lastly section \textit{\nameref{4_6_scenario}} gives a good overview about the workflow of the particular components.
