\section{Levels}\label{4_3_stages}
The SLS covers predefined exercises, which are subdivided in levels that have been discussed in section \textit{\nameref{3_3_2_StagesExercises}}. They follow a structure of a level design in which the user has to unlock each level to make progress. With this an exergame approach is followed to motivate the user for unlocking the next level. Therefore a menu should exist for all available levels as well as for all subdivided exercises. The very first level and exercise should be unlocked and interactable to give the user a starting point. She can then unlock the next level by accomplishing all exercises in the current one. In this way it can be ensured that the user is able to encounter with more difficult exercises in the next level. An introduction into each level should inform the user about the purpose and goals of it, as well as general information about the exercise within that level. Lastly a summary gives an overview of her performance for the entire level.

%The user should also be introduce in each exercise to know how to perform it correctly and give her support for successfully executing it
