\section{Stages}\label{4_3_stages}
The system covers predefined exercises, which are subdivided in stages that have been elaborated in section \textit{\nameref{3_3_2_StagesExercises}}. These are designed as designed as levels, which the user has to unlock. With this a slightly exergame like approach is followed to motivate the user for unlocking the next level. Therefore a menu should exist for all available stages as well as for all exercises within a stage. To give her a starting position, the very first stage and exercise should be interactable. She can then unlock the next stage by accomplishing all exercises in the last one. Hence it can be assured that the user is able to encounter with more difficult exercises in the next stage.An introduction into each stage should inform the user about the purpose and goals of it, as well as general information about the exercise within that stage. Lastly a summary gives an overview of her performance for the entire stage.

%The user should also be introduce in each exercise to know how to perform it correctly and give her support for successfully executing it
