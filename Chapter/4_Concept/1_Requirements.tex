\section{System overview}\label{4_1_requirements}
\subsection{Key elements of a kinect application}
- System should provide a user view, such that the user knows the constraints of the kinect tracking area

\subsection{General}
- user should be tracked with the system
\\- All relevant data should be immediately saved when it is needed (unlocking exercise/stage, failing/accomplish exercise)
\\- system should provide predefined exercises that can be tracked
\\- User selection
\\- A stage menu should be provided to the user, which shows him the amount of stages to complete
\\- lock unlock stages
\\- main menu / exercise selection
\\- lock unlock exercises
\\- click on exercise -> side selection
\\- a stage information scene provides him with the general introduction of this stage --> unlocks first exercise
\\- per exercise there should be an introduction on how to perform it successfully (instruction tip list, looping video)
\\- user has to stay in a starting position (both legs parallel to each other)
- exercise introduction (general information, looping video, right standing position)
- exercise execution (user mirror)

\subsection{Intreraction}
- user can and should interact with the system
\\- Engagement for first interaction with kinect
\\- He should be instructed how to interact --> system should show how to interact with it (tutorial --> clicking + scrolling)

\subsection{Feedback system}
- system should provide feedback to the user about if and how good the exercise is performed
\\ - audio feedback
\\- real time feedback (Time, confidence, checklist)
\\- system should inform how many repetitions are left
\\- system should inform when the repetition is successfully accomplished (audio, visual -> timer green, repetition counter)
\\- system should inform the user if repetition was not successful (audio, visual -> reset timer, checklist)
\\- After successful execution, a summary is shown about the performance of the user (time, attempts, confidence)
\\- tier summary (avg. time, attempts, confidence)
