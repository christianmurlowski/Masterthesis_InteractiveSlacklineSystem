\section{Conclusion}
 Slacklining can be compared with ropedancing but with a wider and more flat ribbon. It is a sport activity that claims a certain amount of balancing skills. Therefore two methods exists for skill acquisition, which are the methodical routine and dynamic methodic. The interactive learning system will focus on the methodical routine because it follows a clear workflow and its structured routine can be easily implemented into the system as a prototype. With the help of Kroi√ü~\cite{Kroiss2007-ab} and other research papers a set of exercises have been elaborated that fit in this routine and train beginners appropriately.
