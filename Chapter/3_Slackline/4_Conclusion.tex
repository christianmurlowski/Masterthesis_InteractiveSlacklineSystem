\section{Conclusion}
Slacklining can be compared with ropedancing but with a wider and flater ribbon.
It is a sport that claims a certain amount of balancing skills.
Therefore, two learning techniques have been discussed for skill acquisition, which are the methodical routine and dynamic method.
The SLS presented in this work will focus on the methodical routine.
This technique follows a clear workflow and its structured routine can be easily implemented into the system as a prototype.
Lastly a set of exercises have been designed that fit in this routine and train beginners appropriately.
%With the help of Kroi√ü~\cite{Kroiss2007-ab} and other works a set of exercises have been designed that fit in this routine and train beginners appropriately.
