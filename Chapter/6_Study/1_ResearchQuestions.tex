\section{Research questions}
\todo{adjust}

The idea is to measure and evaluate the learning progress of beginners with different training methods. Like stated in Section \todo{section} a human trainer is the common way of learning slacklining. Therefore the human trainer will be used as a 
 Therefore the SLS will be compared against this method to show if it can compete against it. It is a \textit{think aloud} study, so that the participant has to share her thoughts and the way she thinks when making an action.

\todo{----------------}

The focus of this thesis relies on teaching beginner how to properly use, stand, and walk on a slackline. At the same time it should motivate the user to use the system as well as bring him closer to slacklining. Therefore several question arise that have to be analysed and discussed.

\begin{itemize}
\item An interactive training system with real time feedback has some statistically relevant influence regarding the performance of teaching beginners compared to other common training methods (personal trainer)
\item The system will support the user in fast changing balancing exercises
\item It motivates the user to learn new skills and techniques
\item Such a system is usable for the field of sport slacklining
\item The exercises provided by the system are challenging but provide a good sense of training for beginners
\end{itemize}
