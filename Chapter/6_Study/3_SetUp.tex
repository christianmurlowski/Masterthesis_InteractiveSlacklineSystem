\section{Apparatus}
The Kinect was attached on a tripod with a height of 90 cm. It was placed in front of the screen on which the system interface is visualised. A beamer was placed on the ceiling of the room to project the interface on the screen in front of it. The slackline stood, like discussed in Section~\ref{5_1_technicalFeasibility}, directly in front of the Kinect. A marker was attached on the slackline to provide a starting point for the participant for getting up the line
The set up for the human trainer group was the same, but without the screen. The video camera for recording was placed \todo{behind the slacker in a more diagonal way} to have her actions as well as the interface interaction recorded. The set up was not changed during the study to have the same condition for every participant.
