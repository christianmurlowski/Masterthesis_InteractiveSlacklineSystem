\section{Participants}
A total amount of \todo{number} participants were recruited from \todo{campus/friends/etc}. They were divided into a human trainer (HTG) and interactive system group (ISG), each with \todo{number} participants. Among them \todo{X} were males and \todo{X females}. The age ranged from \todo{min age} to \todo{max range} (\todo{mean, avg, SD}), the body height from \todo{min height} to \todo{max height} (\todo{mean, avg, SD}), and the weight from from \todo{min weight} to \todo{max weight} (\todo{mean, avg, SD}). All participant agreed to train without shoes but with socks to provide a consistent training condition per participant.
In the ISG condition, \todo{X} participants had prior experience with an interactive device whereas \todo{X} participants had few experience and \todo{X} had no experience. Regarding prior slackline experience \todo{some stood either one up to three times on a slackline or never.} All participants had no contact with a slackline in the last two years. No participant had experienced prior knowledge in balance activities. 

The physical activity level was determined with the~\textit{Physical Activity, Exercise and Sport Questionnaire (Bewegungs- und Sportaktivit√§t Fragebogen - BSA-F)} by Fuchs et. al~\cite{Fuchs2015-bsa}. \todo{The activity level in their job and spare time as well as sport activity, ranged from very low active up to highly active (Table \todo{table}).}
The preference of any body side was determined with a \textit{Lateral Preference Inventory Questionnaire} by Coren~\cite{Coren1993-lp}. \todo{Each participant had a strong preference to be right sided.}
 
All participants were briefed and gave their consent for taking part on the study and agreed with audiovisual data recording. The present study was approved by the local ethic commission.
