\section{Participants}\label{6_participants}
A total amount of twelve participants were recruited from the campus of the Saarland University.
% and randomly assigned to either an interactive system group (ISG) or a human trainer group (HTG).
Among them eight were males and four females.

The age ranged from 21 years to 42 years (M=28, SD=6), the body height from 154 cm to 197 cm (M=177 cm, SD=12 cm), and the weight from from 45 kg to 112.5 kg (M=75 kg, SD=19.5 kg).
The lateral performance of the leg was determined with a \textit{Lateral Preference Inventory Questionnaire} by Coren~\cite{Coren1993-lp}.
All participants had moderate to strong preference to the right leg.
The physical activity level was determined with the~\textit{Physical Activity, Exercise and Sport Questionnaire (Bewegungs- und Sportaktivit√§t Fragebogen - BSA-F)} by Fuchs et. al~\cite{Fuchs2015-bsa}.
It is divided into physical activities in their job, in free time and sport activities.
The participants were not familiar with intermediate slacklining or further balance training. They showed no history of muskuloskeletal disorders that may have affected training or testing.

All participants were briefed and gave their consent for taking part on the study and agreed with audiovisual data recording.
The present study was approved by the local ethic commission.
