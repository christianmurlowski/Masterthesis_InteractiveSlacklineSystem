\section{Outline}
The structure of the thesis outlined in the following.
As a groundwork the \textit{\nameref{2_relatedWork}} chapter involves sections of \textit{\nameref{2_2_slacklineTraining}}, a comparison of interactive tracking devices in \textit{\nameref{2_3_interactiveTechnology}}, \textit{\nameref{2_4_methods}}, as well as \textit{\nameref{2_4_UIDesign}}. Chapter \textit{\nameref{3_slacklining}} gives an overview about the sport and how to learn slacklining appropriate with section \textit{\nameref{3_3_learningTechniques}}. The conceptual design is described in chapter \textit{\nameref{4_concept}} with general interaction design principles, interaction with the system, and how to design it related to the slackline exercises elaborated in the previous chapter. Details of the system development are further described in chapter \textit{\nameref{5_systemIntegration}}, which is divided into the sections \textit{\nameref{5_1_systemSetup}}, \textit{\nameref{5_2_dataModel}}, \textit{\nameref{5_3_movementRecognition}}, and \textit{\nameref{5_4_software}}.
The study structure, methods, results, and discussion can be found in chapter \textit{\nameref{6_study}}. Lastly, chapter \textit{\nameref{7_conclusion}} comprises the findings of the thesis and gives approaches and recommendations for future work.
