\chapter{System integration}\label{5_systemIntegration}
This chapter shows the implementation of the interactive learning system with real-time feedback regarding the conceptual elaboration. Like seen in subsection ~\textit{\nameref{trackingTechnologie}} the Microsoft Kinect v2 will be used as tracking technology. Hence before going into the implementation detail section~\textit{\nameref{5_3_technicalFeasibility}} clarifies the feasibility and the performance of tracking persons on a slackline with the Kinect. Further section \textit{\nameref{5_2_gestureConstruction}} describes the recording and training of predefined gestures for the exercises in the system. After this section \textit{\nameref{5_3_systemArchitecture}} describes the general system architecture which involves the interplay of the Kinect SDK with Unity3D as game engine. Further it involves more specific how the data management, engagement, interaction components, gesture integration, and real-time feedback are implemented. Finally section \textit{\nameref{5_4_userInterface}} covers the design process of the application inlcuding scribbles, mockups and the final integration.

\begin{comment}
- Kinect used for tracking --> how Kinect tracks user - skeleton, infrared, own algorithm -> RW

- Technical feasibility in here?

- Recording of gestures --> Kinectstudio --> Making/Train gestures --> Visual gestures builder

- System architecture of system --> Unity3D, Kinect SDK, Kinectstudio, VGB --> kinect sdk free to use since version X

- Data management --> json file, default exercise json and each user has its own json file 

- Engagement with Kinect

- Interaction components (track hand joints, PHIZ, Constraints) --> different interactions tested (closing hand, V-sign, hover, pushing) --> not all good because of distance to Kinect --> In unity addon written for managing data --> create new users, load exercise in user, adjust jsons

- tier and exercises as level design --> locked and unlocking by successfully accomplishing exercise

- Integration VGB databases in Unity and how to track gestures in it --> gesturedetector, eventlistener

- Providing feedback properly --> confidence/progress of gestures in event listener, checklist (joint detection), 
--> user viewer --> how it works (making cloudy map regarding user position, drawing lines for skeletons)

- Summary screen --> feedback about prior or entire tier performance with time, confidence and attempts

- User interface design --> sketches, mock ups, development --> workflow figure

\section{User Interface}\label{5_4_userInterface}
The user should be introduced to the stage. In here the purpose, goal, and helpful techniques should be given, such that the user becomes an overview about the exercises. At last a summary scene shows several performance parameter for the exercises in this stage.

The user starts with an engagement gesture like raising her hand over the head to convey that the system initially recognises and responds to a user action. After that a tutorial about the interaction with the system will be given that covers clicking and scrolling techniques. Now she's confident with the system interaction and can select a profile in the user select to train. This loads the profile which leads to the stage selection menu. In here she can select a stage, whereas initially the first one is can be selected and the others have to be unlocked by successfully accomplishing all exercises in the preview stage. Selecting a stage leads to the exercise menu. In here she has to read initially the stage introduction to become a basic understanding about the exercises in here. After reading this, it unlocks the first exercise. Selecting an exercise leads to the side selection, where the user has to choose the side she wants to train for this exercise. This is followed by an introduction of the exercise, in which is explained how to perform it correctly. If the user is ready, she should stay in a starting position to be able to start the exercise execution. In here she find all relevant elements to perform the exercise, like indicators for the time, repetitions, confidence and a checklist, which helps her to correctly execute the exercise. After successfully executing the exercise, a summary is shown which summarizes the user performance. Then she can return to the main menu or directly approach the next exercise. A stage summary gives an overview about all exercises with average performance parameters.
