\chapter{\todo{System implementation}}\label{5_systemIntegration}
This chapter discusses the implementation of the interactive learning system with real-time feedback regarding the conceptual elaboration. Like seen in section \textit{\nameref{3_2_slacklineVariations}} a mobile slackline device is the best solution for the learning system. This makes it easy to vary its position and rotate it accordingly. In the slacklining learning system the user should be free in his movement and match predefined exercises. Therefore like already discussed in subsection~\textit{\nameref{trackingTechnologie}} the low-cost tracking camera Microsoft Kinect v2 will be used as tracking device. Before going into detail of the implementation section~\textit{\nameref{5_3_technicalFeasibility}} clarifies the feasibility and the performance of tracking persons on a slackline with the Kinect. Section \textit{\nameref{5_2_gestureConstruction}} describes the recording and training of predefined exercises for the system. After that section \textit{\nameref{5_3_systemArchitecture}} explains the general system architecture which involves the interplay of the Kinect SDK with Unity3D as game engine. Further it involves more specific topics like data management, the implementation of interaction components, gesture integration, and real-time feedback. Finally section \textit{\nameref{5_4_userInterface}} covers the design process of the application including scribbles, mockups and the final integration.

\begin{comment}
- Kinect used for tracking --> how Kinect tracks user - skeleton, infrared, own algorithm -> RW

- Technical feasibility in here?

- Recording of gestures --> Kinectstudio --> Making/Train gestures --> Visual gestures builder

- System architecture of system --> Unity3D, Kinect SDK, Kinectstudio, VGB --> kinect sdk free to use since version X

- Data management --> json file, default exercise json and each user has its own json file 

- Engagement with Kinect

- Interaction components (track hand joints, PHIZ, Constraints) --> different interactions tested (closing hand, V-sign, hover, pushing) --> not all good because of distance to Kinect --> In unity addon written for managing data --> create new users, load exercise in user, adjust jsons

- tier and exercises as level design --> locked and unlocking by successfully accomplishing exercise

- Integration VGB databases in Unity and how to track gestures in it --> gesturedetector, eventlistener

- Providing feedback properly --> confidence/progress of gestures in event listener, checklist (joint detection), 
--> user viewer --> how it works (making cloudy map regarding user position, drawing lines for skeletons)

- Summary screen --> feedback about prior or entire tier performance with time, confidence and attempts

- User interface design --> sketches, mock ups, development --> workflow figure

\section{User Interface}\label{5_4_userInterface}
The user starts with an engagement gesture which is implemented as raising her hand over the head. After that a tutorial about interaction techniques of the system will be given. Now that she's confident with the system interaction she can select her profile in the user menu. This loads the profile which leads further to the level selection menu. In here she can select a level, whereas initially the first one is can be selected. Selecting a level leads to the exercise menu. In here she has to read initially the stage introduction to become a basic understanding about the exercises within. After reading this, it unlocks the first exercise. Selecting an exercise leads to the side selection, where the user has to choose the side she wants to train. This is followed by an introduction of the exercise, in which is explained how to perform it correctly. If the user is ready, she should stay in a starting position to be able to start the exercise execution. Then she find herself in the exercise execution scene. It provides indicators to correctly execute the exercise, like the time, repetitions, confidence and a checklist. After finishing with the exercise, a summary is shown which summarizes the user performance. Then she can return to the main menu or directly try the next exercise. At the end of each stage an overall summary gives an overview about all exercises with average performance parameters.

The user should be introduced to the stage. In here the purpose, goal, and helpful techniques should be given, such that the user becomes an overview about the exercises. At last a summary scene shows several performance parameter for the exercises in this stage.
